1
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,753
You gonna say somethin'
or what?

2
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,256
It's your time.

3
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,647
- What's he doin' here?
-

4
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,016
a friend of mine
just walked right by.

5
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,902
Heshie. He has a 3:00.

6
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,922
Yeah.

7
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:40,426
Yeah, baby.

8
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,807
Oh, yeah.

9
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,810
What the hell's goin' on?

10
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,812
Thunderstorms.

11
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:06,569
- Jackie?
- You smell it? That's rain.

12
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,457
Dr. Melfi, what the hell
you doin' to me?

13
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:24,220
Go back to sleep.

14
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,241
What are you doin' up?
You got school tomorrow.

15
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,244
Workin' on a high score.
Did your mother
go to bed?

16
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,748
Yeah. Where were you?

17
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,001
Yeah. Compactor went down
at barone sanitation.

18
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:01,007
Move over.

19
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,012
Ready?
Yeah.

20
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,015
Go. Watch out
for the ghosts.

21
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,018
Whoa!

22
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,520
This thing ain't
steerin' right.

23
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,522
Yeah, kickin' your butt.

24
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,525
So how things goin' with you?

25
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,030
How's school?

26
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:34,791
Dad, you have
to concentrate. New game.

27
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,297
Hey, no fair.
It's called a handicap.

28
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:45,168
- Come on. Stop. Stop.
- Kickin' your ass now.

29
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,804
One hand. Look at that.
I can't see. Ha, ha.

30
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:55,928
Get off! Ow!
Stop! Come on!

31
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,935
You lose.
Focus through distractions.

32
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,939
There's a lesson for ya.
I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

33
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:12,328
Andretti, you listenin' to me?

34
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,832
Good night, dad.
Good night.

35
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,452
Dr. Nathan, please
return to e. R. Bay five.

36
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,956
Where'd you park?
In the parking lot.

37
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,460
No one followed me.
Adriana, you wouldn't
know it if they did.

38
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,964
Oh, yeah, like tony soprano's
hidin' in my backseat.
You are so paranoid.

39
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:37,470
Bring the car right here.
I know. He's in disguise.

40
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:42,358
That could be him. Hey, tony!
Or maybe he's in the trash can.

41
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,361
Come out, come out,
wherever you are. Ow!

42
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,864
Let go of me!

43
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:51,868
It could be anybody anytime.
I don't even know if
it's tony who's after me.

44
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,871
Christopher,
you gave crystal meth
to hisdaughter.

45
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,241
Which i'm not sure he knows.
Look at my wrist.
It's all red.

46
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,127
I'm sorry! I am sorry!

47
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,882
But i got dragged out
to the fuckin' meadowlands
by my neck, mock execution!

48
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,501
What?

49
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,636
What?
Nothin'.

50
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,639
No. What?
You don't want to know,
okay? Trust me.

51
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,142
No. What?

52
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,146
I heard the nurse say you made
number two in your pants.
Is that what happened?

53
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:25,151
Get the car! Please!
Can we just go to brendan's,
score some shit...

54
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,654
and find out what the fuck
is goin' on, please?

55
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,776
The moon. The full moon!

56
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,279
Brendan, let's go.
Wake up, man.

57
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,281
For the exact time.

58
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,785
The fool leaves
his door open.

59
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:44,787
I gotta pee.
Go for it.

60
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,789
Yo, einstein.
You should have seen me
at the hospital.

61
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:51,294
It took three nurses
to hold me--

62
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,297
you will understand and comply
with the following orders.

63
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:57,550
All security personnel are to be
equipped with silver bullets.

64
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,686
Those silver bullets are
to be blessed by a priest,
not in english, but in latin.

65
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,691
All passengers and personnel
are to be restricted
to their cabins...

66
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,693
with the doors
bolted and locked.

67
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,196
End of orders! Sir!
Yes, sir!

68
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,698
Take him below.
Take him below.

69
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:20,072
Yeah. Yeah. Uh- huh.
That's the message. Thanks.

70
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,575
Way to go, anth!

71
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:27,079
Here, in five, four,
three, two.

72
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,583
Yo. Yo, check it.

73
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,480
You think this is funny?

74
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,483
What? What's funny?
Yeah, i didn't do nothin'.

75
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:49,485
You beep me one more time,
you're gonna be sorry.

76
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,988
We don't know what
you're talking about.

77
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,990
"Your mother blows."
That's a real original message.

78
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:57,860
Yeah, maybe she does,
right, anth?
Yeah.

79
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,863
Oh, yeah? Then why'd
you scarf up all the doughnuts
she sent us at camp?

80
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:05,251
And you used to cry on her
shoulder,"i'm so homesick,
mrs. Piocosta!"

81
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,254
Why don't you shut up?

82
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,506
Have another doughnut,
ya fat fart knocker.

83
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,264
Oh, go on! Kill'im!
Yeah!

84
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,266
Oh, yes!

85
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,768
Dick wad!
Ass!

86
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:27,273
Hey! Break it up.
Break it up!

87
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,276
I want a five- minute
cooldown period right now.

88
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,402
See ya next week, doc.

89
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:42,905
Oh, mr. Dante,
you forgot something.
Oh, thank you, baby.

90
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:46,292
- Don't forget to keep flossing.
- You saved my life.

91
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,795
All right.
All right.
See you next week, all right?

92
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,301
Can i help you, sir?

93
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,304
Sir? Sir?

94
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:22,828
Oh, my god.

95
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,333
I'm having
second thoughts.
About?

96
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,453
This whole thing,
the whole arrangement.

97
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:34,457
Security.

98
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:37,960
I come here. I tell you things.
I don't know how safe it is.

99
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,463
I understand
your concerns.

100
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:44,600
But i told you what the ground
rules are. As long as i don't
hear anything incriminating--

101
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,604
you don't fuckin' get it.
Just my bein' here
incriminates me.

102
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:52,608
Somebody sees me, they tell
somebody else. All of a sudden,
i'm a celebrity!

103
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:56,612
I thought
we made some progress
of your narcissism.

104
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,116
Who are you?

105
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,486
Why is that so important
for you to know?

106
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:08,124
My mother told me
never to answer a question
with a question.

107
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,877
So, your mother
did teach you something.

108
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:16,132
If i asked you about your life,
who you talked to,
who you trust--

109
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,001
i'd have to take the fifth.

110
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,506
That's cute.

111
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:27,009
Oh! I--

112
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,514
i-- i'm sorry.
I wasn't aware of
what i was...saying.

113
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,517
I'm...sorry.

114
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,026
Hey, what are you
doing here?

115
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:47,029
Chris sent me to pick you up.
Chris? Why?
Did something happen?

116
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,282
Must be my dad, right?
Why else would chris send you?

117
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,785
Did brendan get my poem?

118
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,287
It's probably nothing.
Another search warrant.

119
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,289
He calls them the federal bureau
of annoying bullshit.

120
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,793
You told your old man,
didn't you?
You scared me. What happened?

121
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,798
This is me and adriana movin'
to florida'cause some puke
couldn't keep your mouth shut.

122
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,684
What are you talking about?
Seriously. Did brendan
say anything about me?

123
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:12,054
Get us outta here!
Get us out!

124
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:16,058
What did you tell your old man?
About the meth? You insane?
He'd have me beaten up!

125
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,561
Don't you get it?
This is serious!

126
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,447
Let go of me!
Listen--

127
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,566
stop this shit!
He's worried about you.

128
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:26,819
He's been asking where
you've been, you asshole!

129
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,322
I'm sorry if i hurt ya.

130
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,826
I hate my life,
being a soprano.
Hey.

131
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,329
Don't ever say you hate life.
That's blasphemy.

132
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,331
Fuck you.

133
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,835
Okay, let's go. Remember
like when you were little.

134
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,337
I'll buy you one of those
happy meals, all right?

135
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,840
Where the fuck are you?

136
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:02,905
This is a new shirt.

137
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,908
Your grandmother
bought you this shirt.
I find it in the trash?

138
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,911
It's a westport.
It's not even cool anymore.

139
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,781
What did you just say?

140
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,784
I got in a fight.
I hope it was worth it.

141
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:18,287
I hope you did as much
damage to his wardrobe.
Who with?

142
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,289
I didn't get caught.
No demerits.

143
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:24,293
Anthony, who?
Jeremy.

144
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:29,682
Jeremy piocosta? You spent
all that time together at camp.
I thought you were friends.

145
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,553
Well, if that's all
the information i'm getting,
i'm calling mrs. Piocosta.

146
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,939
No, ma, wait.
Ma, don't call.

147
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,442
I swear. You kids
are going to learn
the value of a dollar.

148
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,445
I'll wash your car.
You never put
any effort in.

149
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,448
I will. I promise.
I'll do it really good.

150
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,450
Just don't call.
I'll get the money.

151
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,953
Forty dollars, anthony.
I know, i know.

152
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,963
Ma!

153
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:04,467
How ya doin'?
What brings you here?

154
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,970
Remember that pastry place,
ferrara's?

155
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,973
Brought you
some macaroons.

156
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:14,477
Oh, they're too sweet.

157
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:17,480
What are you talkin' about?
They're your favorites.

158
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,986
The activities director, rosie,

159
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:28,491
says they're organizing
a trip to the city.

160
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,494
Dinner and a show.

161
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,996
And you don't wanna go.

162
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:37,500
I don't like
the people here.
You don't know the people here.

163
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,505
And that city.
Grown men soiling themselves.

164
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,875
- It's not like that anymore, ma.
- That giuliani.

165
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,510
Maybe we should just
stick to the field trip.

166
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,514
Mothers throwin' their babies
out of skyscraper windows.

167
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,633
You're always with
the babies out the windows.

168
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,138
I don't see you tryin' to mix
with the other ladies here...

169
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:03,275
or talk to the nice gents
i see walkin' around.

170
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,895
You're not makin'
the most of your opportunities.
What do you care?

171
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:09,398
Out of sight, out of mind.

172
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:13,402
We don't think like that,
not me or carm or the kids.

173
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:16,405
I wish the lord
would take me now.

174
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,161
I come here to get cheered up.
You think that's a mistake?

175
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,664
You bein' sarcastic?

176
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,417
You can't put
all your problems on me.

177
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,921
This is the most expensive
retirement community
in new jersey.

178
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:35,925
If you wanted to, you could be
happy here, but you're just
pissing it all down the drain.

179
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:38,928
What beautiful language
for your mother.

180
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,321
You want the macaroons?

181
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,324
I don't care.

182
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,702
Leave some out
for the lunatics.

183
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,853
Good- bye, ma.

184
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,610
They're saying
it might rain today.

185
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,118
Don't worry. I'll drive safe.

186
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:42,124
What the hell are you doing?

187
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:45,628
This place is an hour
from my office.
An hour?

188
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,130
What are you, a woman?
Get a bladder transplant.
My mother lives here.

189
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,633
It's not real
convenient for me.

190
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,135
It's not convenient?
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:58,140
Why don't we meet by your
precinct? The government would
love pictures of us together.

192
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,643
What do you got for me?

193
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,648
Here.

194
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:09,151
"Jennifer melfi, m. D."
Yeah. Her background,
daily routine.

195
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,654
And your personal
relationship
with her is?

196
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,156
None of your
fuckin' business.

197
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,158
You can't blame a guy
for tryin'.

198
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:18,661
What are you,
bored with your life?
Oh, yeah, sure.

199
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,163
Bustin' whores and junkies.

200
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,284
Plus, it's a super huge thrill
to pay two alimonies on
a $40, 000- a- year income.

201
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,787
I don't want her touched.
I don't want her bothered.

202
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,290
I just want to know
the who, when, why.
That's it.

203
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,293
Usual fee?

204
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:39,298
The knicks lost, lieutenant.
You're down two large.

205
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,301
Lay off the vig.
We'll see what kind
of job you do.

206
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,304
Okay. See you in a few days.
What ya got in the box?

207
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,806
Macaroons.

208
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,533
This is awful.

209
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,035
I can't deal with this.

210
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:05,791
What kind of god? Hmm?

211
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,162
Christopher!
Where you been?

212
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:13,048
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

213
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,551
Brendan's dead.
What are you talkin' about?

214
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:18,053
The fish is in my pocket.

215
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,174
Brendan's brains are
floatin' in his bathtub.
Message job through the eye.

216
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,310
- Mo green special.
- Fuckin' uncle junior.

217
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,312
What are you talkin' about,
mo green?

218
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,315
In one, mo green's
eyes got too big
for his stomach,

219
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,317
so they put a small
caliber in his eye.

220
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,937
- Mikey palmice does their hits.
- In his glasses, you mean.

221
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:36,939
Glasses, eyes.
Why you quibbling with me?

222
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,942
I'm at the world trade center.

223
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,331
What are you doin'?

224
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,701
Mikey palmice is a made guy.
Cocksucker didn't have
the balls to do it himself.

225
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,704
Contracted fuckin' russians
and he killed my friend.

226
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:56,842
Our response should
suit the message.

227
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,962
Through the mouth
means the guy was a rat.

228
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:04,216
The eye is just how
francis framed the shot,
for the shock value.

229
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,718
Brendan didn't deserve this.
Don't try to talk me out of it.

230
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,720
You can't touch mikey.

231
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,724
Your fuckin' uncle's
pissin' on your head.
What do you expect me to do?

232
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:17,729
I'm on it. I know where
mikey's house is
over by route ten.

233
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:22,234
No. He tries to leave,
you break his other neck.

234
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,251
Nurse bradley,
you're wanted in e. R.

235
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,255
Nurse bradley,
you're wanted in e. R.

236
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,151
Hey, mr. G. Q.
Hey.

237
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:58,153
Got a ticket.
Yeah.

238
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,772
How ya doin', mikey?
How ya doin'--

239
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,664
son of a--
look.

240
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:10,666
Your suit's wrinkled.
Let me fix it.

241
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,287
- Ow!
- What are you screaming about?
Free alterations.

242
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:18,040
Ow! Ow!
Mr. Slick.

243
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,295
This is overdue.

244
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,190
You hear about
the chinese godfather?

245
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,192
He made them an offer
they couldn't understand.

246
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:40,812
You gonna stop this
before it gets out of hand?

247
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:45,951
- Not even a hello?
- I'm here'cause i love you
and i respect you.

248
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,453
Don't pretend
you're payin' me respect.

249
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,455
A son who throws his mother
in an asylum.

250
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,458
She lives like
apoverettoup there.

251
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,961
That's none
of your business.

252
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,966
Your friends-- they interfere
in my business. They expect me
to turn the cheek.

253
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,218
The truck and all that
was made good to you.

254
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:07,839
I'm sitting here like patience
on a monument, waitin' for
discipline to be handed down.

255
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,342
Your boys were warned,
and still they embarrass me.

256
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,346
I run my crew my way.
What you did was extreme.

257
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:19,101
Now you're my judge?
I answer to bigger people
than you, my friend.

258
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:23,605
Oh? Like jackie?
Wanna take this
to his deathbed?

259
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:30,362
That nephew of yours
we gave a high colonic,
uh, he earns good?

260
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,367
He's comin' up.
Okay.

261
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,753
He works for me now.

262
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,255
Excuse me.

263
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:43,125
Maybe he gives youagito
for a change.

264
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:48,513
You got some set of balls.
You know that?
Absolutely not.

265
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,517
I show you my hand,
and you slap it away.

266
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:02,027
What's the matter with you?
Why can't we talk like
adults anymore, hmm?

267
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:07,032
Out. Next time you come in,
you come heavy or not at all.

268
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,537
You don't mean that.

269
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:39,731
So by the time i get to take
the sergeant exam, of course,
the pay scale is frozen by law.

270
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,733
Why are we following
these people?

271
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,736
They grabbed a meal,
saw a movie, so what?

272
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,356
Lucky for you
they stopped off
at that package store.

273
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:52,110
- Yeah, i got a juice.
- Yeah, i can smell the potatoes.

274
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,112
Hey, listen, asshole.

275
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,616
Same make and model
left the scene of a triple
homicide on long island.

276
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,118
Stay fuckin' current.

277
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:07,376
So you broke it off with
the poorshlubafter a week?

278
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:12,881
I know. I feel for you males.
It's our goddamn fault
you don't know how to act.

279
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,884
Oh, admitting mistakes.

280
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:20,389
We tell you
to be more sensitive.
You join promise keepers.

281
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:23,892
We say get in touch
with your feelings.

282
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:28,897
You run off into the woods
in a loincloth, gunking yourself
with bear fat, beating a drum.

283
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,400
Hey, don't ruin my evening.

284
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,902
You know what i mean.

285
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:37,406
Sure. You want someone
who's sensitive to your needs...

286
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:40,909
but still decisive enough
for the occasional grope
in the closet.

287
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,413
Yeah. Something like that.

288
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:48,917
Oh, shit.
That's all i need.

289
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,304
We were going over
the speed limit?

290
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,307
I wasn't looking.
Pull over.

291
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,699
License and
registration, please.

292
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:25,704
Uh, i'm sorry, officer.
Did i do something wrong?

293
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,590
Detective.

294
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,593
You crossed a double line.
Have you been drinking, sir?

295
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,712
We had wine with dinner.

296
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,348
Step out of the car, please.

297
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,850
I don't believe this.

298
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,855
Just relax, randall,
and do what he says, okay?

299
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,361
I need you to walk
a straight line to me, sir.
Heel to toe.

300
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:54,733
Look, uh,
i applaud your vigilance,
but this is totally unnecessary.

301
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,235
All right? I'm a lawyer.
I know i'm under the limit.

302
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,988
Open the trunk, please.
What?

303
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,490
You want to search
my golf bag?

304
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,992
Open it!
I will not.

305
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,244
You ever hear
of probable cause?

306
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,747
Oh, yeah, that's
a real good legalese--
what?

307
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,133
Oh, you resisting arrest?

308
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,635
- Hey!
-

309
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:16,138
vin, will you fuckin'
cool it? Vin!

310
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,640
He can't do that!
Get back in the car!

311
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,642
He didn't do
anything wrong!
Ma'am!

312
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:24,146
Back in the car. Now.

313
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,647
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:29,151
I perceived what
i thought was a weapon.

315
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:32,654
What the hell's
wrong with you, vin?

316
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:36,158
Take him. D. U. I. ,
resisting arrest, assaulting
an officer. Do it now.

317
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:38,660
What's he--
do it!

318
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,162
Jesus.

319
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,667
Don't you touch me!

320
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:49,671
You got prime rib at home.
Don't be goin' out
for hamburgers.

321
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,674
What? What are you
talking about?

322
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:57,179
Randall! Randall!
I'll follow you!

323
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,183
I'm gonna call my lawyer, you!
Fuck you!

324
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,302
She's seeing a randall curtin,
tax lawyer.

325
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:10,308
He's lives at
1242 rennsalaer road.

326
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,311
He's divorced.
He's got two kids.

327
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:17,816
He's the country club type.
Not much in the balls
department, i might add.

328
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,568
What about her?

329
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:23,572
Her, the good doctor, she's
in her office at 8:00 a. M.
She leaves at 6:00.

330
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:25,574
She orders up a tuna sub
and a diet coke.

331
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:30,078
She's got a three- bedroom condo
in essex fells,
shops at pathmark.

332
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:33,081
She's divorced.
One kid, 19.

333
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:37,085
Outside of schmucko,
she don't get out much,
but she does see a shrink.

334
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,588
She what?
Yeah.

335
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:43,725
She sees a shrink once a week.
His name is elliot kupferburg.

336
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:46,094
Oh, fuck me.

337
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:49,598
Well, she don't fuck anyone
from what i can tell.

338
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:52,100
Well, it's not because
she don't got the goods.

339
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,103
She left her blinds up.
I got some of them
victoria secrettype snaps.

340
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:59,608
If you're interested.
A little of this?

341
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:01,610
Good enough then?
Yeah.

342
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,863
- You got any advil?
- What am i, a fuckin'
pharmacy now?

343
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,868
What you got on friday's game?
I got three bills on rutgers.

344
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,872
I don't solve
all your problems.

345
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,266
Thank you.

346
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,135
With a stapler? Wow.

347
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,638
I heard mikey had to
give up that nice suit.

348
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:33,642
Yeah?
He got too attached to it.

349
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:38,647
Michael palmice's been
a disease since he was five.
He had it comin'.

350
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:41,650
It don't make things
any easier though.
My uncle's a stubborn man.

351
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:44,786
Stubborn enough to go to war?

352
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,042
What kind of word is that?

353
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:56,548
There hasn't been a war
since the columbo thing.
Everybody decided.

354
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,050
No one's goin' to
the mattresses this day and age.

355
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,554
I got a top- of- the- line
posturpedic at my house.
Fuck it.

356
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,558
If jackie hadn't
gotten sick, none of this
would have happened.

357
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,060
When you're right,
you're right.

358
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,564
One of us captains gotta
step up. Lack of control at the
top is fuckin' up this family.

359
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,567
- That's true.
- You can say that again.

360
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:20,071
If the old man were here,
instead of in that cell
in springfield,

361
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,074
he'd say,"raymond,
this is your moment."

362
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:26,077
Go easy with
the grease gun, okay?
What?

363
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,582
You're the boy wonder.
Both him and jackie
had you picked from day one.

364
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,084
You got the age.
You got the seniority.

365
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,088
I also got an 18- year- old
with m. S. , okay?

366
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,591
I told nucci
i'd be doin' less, not more.

367
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,594
All due respect to your
crippled kid, you don't
want a wire up your ass.

368
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,596
You don't want the headache.

369
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,599
That's why you should be boss.
You're so fuckin' smart.

370
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,101
And it's
"physically challenged."

371
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,604
Absolutely.

372
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,107
Why don't we run this thing
like a council?

373
00:27:56,608 --> 00:28:00,612
Larry, the old guys set this up
as a paramilitary organization.

374
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:06,117
We need a supreme commander
at the top, not the fuckin'
dave clark five.

375
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,621
Face it. You and junior
are gonna have to duke it out.

376
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,625
You gotta be boss.
Number one:
I love the man.

377
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,129
Number two:
He's got new york behind him.

378
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:22,133
Not for anything,
god bless your uncle, but he's
livin' in the wrong century,

379
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,135
and new york knows it.

380
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:28,139
You want it, t?
You'll get their okay.

381
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,643
It's the right thing.
It's inevitable.

382
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,146
I don't want no disturbance.

383
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,163
Hey, what's up?
Nothin'.

384
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:55,417
I bet you told your mom
what happened.

385
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:58,286
What are you, high?

386
00:28:58,286 --> 00:29:02,290
Well, you owe me 40 bucks
for the shirt. The collar
was totally ripped.

387
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,426
You still owe me
for fourth of july.

388
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:06,177
Bottle rockets?
I paid for them.

389
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:10,181
Not for the m80s.
Remember? The ones
you blew up the frogs with.

390
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:14,185
- Oh, yeah.
That was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

391
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,689
Listen. Just give me the money.

392
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:21,192
- That thing was so gay.
I did you a favor.
- You're gonna do it.

393
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:23,311
Make me, fatty.

394
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:26,314
- Dick wad.
- Asshole.

395
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:29,818
Whoa!

396
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,821
Shithead.

397
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:35,323
Bitch-- come on.

398
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,077
Let's go, shithead.

399
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,080
- Let me go!
- Why? So i can
kick your ass again?

400
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,216
- I was kicking your ass.
- Nobody won. It was a draw.

401
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:49,721
The pit tomorrow, 3:00.

402
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:53,341
You gotta help me
with these cinch bugs.
They're killing my sweet corn.

403
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:56,845
Well, this blue stuff works
pretty well, and it's safe
for the environment.

404
00:29:56,845 --> 00:30:00,348
I tried that.
You got any d. D. T. Back there?

405
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,735
Uh, that stuff's illegal.
It's been banned.

406
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,105
Maybe you got a surplus in the
back, you could go, you look.
I'll meet you back there.

407
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,858
Look, mr. Soprano,
if i could do
something, i would--

408
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:14,496
mr. Piocosta! Right?
How ya doin'?

409
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:19,367
Remember our boys went
to camp aheka together?

410
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:22,003
Of course. Tony.
How are ya?
Good. Good.

411
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,873
Your kid still got
that killer crossover dribble?

412
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:28,376
- Yeah, i guess so.
- That's gonna get him
a scholarship.

413
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:31,012
- So how's anthony?
- He's moody, you know?

414
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:34,516
For a kid that age,
you know?

415
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,634
It was nice seein' ya, tony.

416
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:40,271
Why don't we get together and
cook up some dogs for the boys?

417
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:44,776
Tony, i-- i don't even know
if these guys are close anymore.

418
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,278
Did anthony mention
anything to you?

419
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,531
I'll have carmela call joanie.
We'll get together.

420
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,650
- Linda.
- Linda.

421
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,286
That's great.
Tony, that's great.

422
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,289
I'll see you around.

423
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,325
Tony?

424
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,328
Yeah.
Oh, my god.

425
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,330
Tony?

426
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:47,839
I thought the medication
was supposed to help
your panic attacks.

427
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,844
It-- it does.
It's the first one in a while.

428
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,348
What does your therapist say?
He should increase your dosage.

429
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,851
He's got more degrees
than a thermometer.

430
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,354
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

431
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,359
Does your therapist
ask questions
about our marriage?

432
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,362
I know that personal
feelings are hard for you
to talk about.

433
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,867
Talk. That's
all we do is talk.

434
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,369
Carm, i'm gonna quit.

435
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,874
Did you bring
this up with him?
Yeah.

436
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,377
He knows. I guess.

437
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,383
Oh, shit. I forgot to take
my fuckin' prozac this mornin'.

438
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,386
It's up in the bathroom.
Can you get it?

439
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:41,893
I know with jackie sick
you're under
tremendous pressure.

440
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,397
But i feel if
the therapy didn't hurt,
it wouldn't be helping.

441
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,901
No, you don't understand.

442
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,905
That's why you're
in therapy. Because
i don't understand!

443
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,909
I'm telling you, tony,
if you give up now, i'm gonna
have to reevaluate things.

444
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,411
What is that, huh?

445
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,414
I got a very sensitive job.
I'm not an average joe
on the block.

446
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,417
I gotta spell it out for you?
It's our marriage, tony!

447
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,419
Therapy is
too much exposure.
Fine!

448
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,923
You live with
the results then!

449
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,425
What's that, a threat?

450
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,295
No, tony.
It's a rave review.

451
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,797
You get your own
fuckin' pills.

452
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,021
How long did the attack last?

453
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,023
About 30 seconds.

454
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:35,396
I was dizzy, out of breath.
That's it though.
I never lost consciousness.

455
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:38,900
Anything since?

456
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,905
I'm gonna write
a script for xanax,
just for a couple of days.

457
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:49,043
It'll get you over
this short- term stresses.

458
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:54,549
My uncle. He's got me in a box
where i gotta do something
i don't wanna do.

459
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:01,556
And then there's my mother.

460
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:04,058
I pay four grand a month
for this place,

461
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,063
and she acts like i'm an eskimo,
pushing her out to sea.

462
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:11,816
She's testing.

463
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,770
Same as your uncle.

464
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,157
Like little kids.

465
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:22,276
There's a good book about this.
I'll give you the name.

466
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,412
No, i read, i go right out.

467
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:28,666
It'sstrategies for
coping with elder family.

468
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,537
Can't fuckin' spank'em though.

469
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:37,041
Would it hurt you
to let your mother think
that she's still in charge?

470
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:40,044
You have children.
You know what they're like.

471
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:45,800
You know that sometimes it's
important to let them have the
illusion of being in control.

472
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:58,946
Chris, my man!

473
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:01,949
Surprised to see me?
Heard they took you
for a little ride.

474
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:05,453
Tour of the meadowlands.
Oh, yeah?

475
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:07,955
Heard you had
a little b. M. Out there.

476
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:10,458
- So you got my cut?
- They came and took it.

477
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,461
- Who?
- Junior soprano's boys.

478
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,463
They said you was out,
and it's they corner now.

479
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:19,467
- You let them do that?
- I don't argue too well
suckin' on a smith & wesson.

480
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:23,471
- You didn't beep me?
- Word on the street,
you out of commission.

481
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:25,973
Sorry, man. Business.

482
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:31,979
Chris, you know there's
no one i'd rather give
my ten points to than you.

483
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,234
It's all right.
It's not your fault.

484
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,236
Oh, i'm glad
that you say that, man.

485
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:42,607
Sneaky motherfucker!

486
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:45,993
Oh, shit! Oh!

487
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:51,249
I don't care if they shove
a scud missile up your ass.

488
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:55,753
This is my corner.
You pay anyone but me,
i'm comin' back for your thumbs.

489
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:59,006
And that didn't happen,
what you said!

490
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,264
I'm gonna kill you!

491
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:16,524
If you get in trouble,
go for the takedown.

492
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:20,027
Sweep kick and steamroll.
Game is over.

493
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:22,029
All you're doing
is makin' me nervous.

494
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,033
Do you want a nitro bar?
Would you shut the fuck up?

495
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,905
- He's coming!
- It's the moment of truth.

496
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,438
Here.

497
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:08,075
- What the hell is that?
- Just take it.

498
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,578
I'll fight you for it.

499
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:13,831
- I can't.
- What do you mean, can't?

500
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,201
Just take it!

501
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,090
I knew you'd chicken out.

502
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,712
Man!

503
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,597
He chickened out.
He's scared.

504
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,099
Oh, yeah!
He's real scared ofyou.

505
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,604
What's that supposed to mean?
You won, man! Yeah!
Tonio, you won!

506
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,857
I'm leaving.

507
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,978
Boo!

508
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:20,147
One of the gangland's
youngest alleged leaders...

509
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:23,401
died late this afternoon
at st. Isaac's hospital.

510
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,903
Turn it off.
Turn the music off!
Giacomo "jackie" aprile,

511
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:30,408
allegedly one of the state's
top mafia figures was first
hospitalized last year.

512
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:36,414
Authorities called aprile
the acting boss for 74- year- old
ercoli "eckley" demeo,

513
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,784
currently serving
a life sentence in springfield
federal penitentiary.

514
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:45,289
Authorities believe he was made
acting boss for the north jersey
mafia two years ago.

515
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,425
Aprile was 44 years old.

516
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,928
Thank you, heather,
for that live report.

517
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,932
Goddamn it. I was just there.
They told me
he wouldn't go today.

518
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,934
It looks like the possibility
of rain for this weekend.

519
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,439
I'll never forget
where i was this day.

520
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:08,195
It's okay.

521
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:11,699
He was a good man.

522
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,202
Let's do a toast.
Give me a toast.

523
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:20,708
To a great man.
To a great leader.

524
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,711
A great friend.

525
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:27,715
To jackie.

526
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:32,219
Buonanima.
Buonanima.

527
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:39,727
T! Ya hear what happened?

528
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:41,595
Just now.

529
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:46,100
That's not all. I go to make
a pickup from yo yo mendez.

530
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,103
He says it ain't my corner
anymore. It's junior's.

531
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:52,106
Christopher.
This ain't the time.
They're movin' in!

532
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:55,609
I say we go to defcon 4!

533
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:58,612
I gotta assess this, all right?

534
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:03,117
What are we, politicians?
Does this look like
the senate to you?

535
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,119
- Hey, hey.
- This is about respect
of our thing!

536
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,621
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
It doesn't concern you!

537
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:12,126
Yes, it is. I represent you
out there, and i'm tired of
puttin' my tail between my legs.

538
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:16,130
This ain't negotiation time.
This isscarface, final scene.

539
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,633
Fuckin' bazookas under each arm.
Say hello to my little friend.

540
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:22,770
Always with the scenarios.

541
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,773
You don't do somethin', i gotta
question your leadership.

542
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:28,776
What the--
you ungrateful little fuck!

543
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:31,278
Where'd you get
the balls to question
my leadership, huh?

544
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,280
I'm just sayin' how it is.

545
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,784
I ought to rip
your fuckin' head off
and finish the job.

546
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:39,787
You're the boss.
That's right.
I am.

547
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:45,292
You're lucky a man
i loved died today.

548
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:58,806
Here we go,
the war of'99.
We should go with him.

549
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:01,809
You do what you're told
when you're told.

550
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:04,812
Adios, junior.

551
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:10,317
Mind your mother now,
hear me?

552
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:16,824
Never mind.

553
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:19,827
A little more.
That's good right there.

554
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,329
Right there?
Yeah, that's good.

555
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,331
All right.

556
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,705
Here! Take this.

557
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:35,209
Uncle junior.

558
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:37,344
I need to talk to ya.

559
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:46,604
I came in heavy, like you said,
but i don't wanna use it.

560
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:05,873
Our friend jackie has died.

561
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,876
I heard.

562
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,128
Now we need a leader.

563
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,882
We do.

564
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:21,388
And i don't want any
confusion or misunderstandin'.

565
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,257
Yes?

566
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:29,763
Sopranos have been waiting
a long time to take the reins.

567
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:37,271
That's why i want it
to be you, uncle jun.

568
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:44,778
This is your decision?

569
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:47,031
It is.

570
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,533
You speak for the captains?

571
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,669
I can.

572
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,173
Come here.

573
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:00,678
You crazycialtrone.
You had me worried there.

574
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,180
You think i'm gonna mess
with a guy like you?
You been pumpin' iron?

575
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,683
You're stronger than a bull.

576
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:10,054
Hey, call parcel's.
Give this guy a tryout, huh?
Come here.

577
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,058
Always the bullshitter.
Just one thing, one thing.

578
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:18,562
You know i can't
be perceived to
lose face, right?

579
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:22,566
So, bloomfield...

580
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,071
and the paving union.

581
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,573
It's my asking price.

582
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,082
Congratulations.

583
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,426
I almost got
in a fight today.

584
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,930
Fight?
With jeremy piocosta.

585
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,432
I take french with his brother.
He's such a poseur.

586
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:59,186
Who won?
No one. He backed out.

587
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,189
Phil litto said,
"yeah, he's real scared of you."

588
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:04,191
When i asked
what that meant,
they all laughed.

589
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:07,194
Duh.
What do you mean?

590
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:10,698
Sometimes you're so naive.

591
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:14,201
What do you think
dad does for a living?
Waste management.

592
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:17,204
Do you know any other
garbage men who live
in a house like this?

593
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:18,706
Uncle jackie.

594
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:21,709
And why do we call him uncle
when he's not even related?

595
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,713
He's in dad'sotherfamily.

596
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:30,601
Come here.

597
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:42,363
I'll print it out for you.

598
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,908
Hi.
Jennifer.

599
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:31,912
I tried calling.
Yeah, the phone's
off the hook.

600
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:33,914
Come on in.

601
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:42,790
I guess we won't
be going to dinner.

602
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,792
I'm worried, jennifer.

603
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:50,798
I think i'm starting
to lose it.

604
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:54,051
I was standing
in line this morning
in the doughnut shop.

605
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:59,556
A man in a booth looked at me.
All of a sudden, i started
shaking uncontrollably.

606
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,059
Lady says,"next."
I ran away.

607
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:10,951
Hey. You've been through
a very traumatic experience.

608
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:18,959
I hate to admit this, but
i'm afraid to go outside.

609
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,966
I...got this crazy idea
that i'm being followed.

610
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:29,970
And this song keeps
running through my head.

611
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,973
"People are strange."
The doors.

612
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:37,978
Where faces look evil
when you're alienated.

613
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:39,980
Randall--

614
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,485
dead at 27
in a paris bathtub.

615
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:47,488
Okay, i think you should go
and talk to mel gelbar.

616
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:50,991
He specializes in
post- traumatic stress disorder.

617
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:53,994
Y- you couldn't
prescribe something?

618
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:56,497
I'm your date,
not your doctor.

619
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:00,501
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah. No.

620
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:37,037
Saw my first dead body
when i was about 15, maybe 16.

621
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:41,041
Won't tell you about how he got
clipped, because it was, uh--

622
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:45,546
sorry.

623
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:49,917
You okay?
I was thinking.

624
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:54,171
I guess i live
a sheltered existence.

625
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,673
How so?

626
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,678
Well, i'm in this room
for ten hours a day.

627
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:04,681
I guess i'm out of touch
with the...

628
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:09,686
climate of rage
in american society,

629
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,689
the casual violence.

630
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:16,443
Your voice is all tight.

631
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:24,952
This week my friend
got beat up...

632
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:27,337
by a policeman, no less.

633
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,340
Oh, yeah?

634
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,845
It was a nightmare.

635
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,214
Wow.

636
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,716
I mean, i don't know
if this cop...

637
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:43,220
was crazy or drunk or what.

638
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:49,226
But he was raving,
"prime rib, hamburger."
It was surreal.

639
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,113
Fuckin' moron.

640
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:58,735
I mean, it sounds like
this guy is a fuckin' moron.

641
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:02,623
My friend's filing suit
against the city.

642
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:06,627
But the worst part of it is,
my relationship with him
will never be the same.

643
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:11,381
Sorry.
Oh, it wasn't your fault.

644
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:17,387
Hey, this is your session.
I'm sorry. This is--

645
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:19,506
hey.
Very unprofessional.

646
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:22,509
No, it's all right.
You had your wits
scared out of you.

647
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,512
Is the xanax helping?

648
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:30,267
Fine. No more attacks.

649
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,904
But you still
have your doubts?

650
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,407
About therapy?

651
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,410
No, no, no, no.
Give it another chance.

652
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,914
Got a lot of good ideas here.

653
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,916
Okay.

654
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:49,670
On how to cope.

655
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:57,427
Tell me why this was
a smart move to make
junior the big willie.

656
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:01,932
Look at him. He's content.
Thinks he's the king of kings.

657
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,937
Truth is, every decision
is made by me.

658
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,939
I still worry
about the money end.

659
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,441
That's'cause that's
what you do. You worry.

660
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:15,445
He doesn't know
we kick back to jackie.

661
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,947
We're gonna do good.

662
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:21,952
Point is, he's got the title.
He's a happy fuckin' camper.

663
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,454
The house is secure.

664
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:28,458
Yeah, only now we got
a brand- new lightning rod
on top to take the hits.

665
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,460
Smart. Very smart.

666
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,964
Yeah, and now
you got bloomfield
and the union chair.

667
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:38,969
Otherwise you'd fuck me, larry,
but you wouldn't respect me
in the morning, would ya?

668
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,471
As long as you guarantee
to keep the old fart in line.

669
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,975
Hey, i still love that man.
I'm his favorite nephew.

670
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,978
Look at him
over there with my ma.

671
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,480
Those people went
through world war ii.

672
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,870
Thank you.

673
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,879
T, check out
the government.

674
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,385
Shooting right to left.

675
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:30,637
Got uncle jun's good side.
