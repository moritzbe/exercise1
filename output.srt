You gonna say somethin'or what?

00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,256
It's your time.

00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:08,647

00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,016

Yeah, baby.

8
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,807
Oh, yeah.

9
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,810
What the hell's goin' on?

10
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,812
Thunderstorms.

11
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:04,569
- Jackie?- You smell it? That's rain.

12
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:09,457
Dr. Melfi, what the hellyou doin' to me?

13
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:22,220
Go back to sleep.

14
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,241
What are you doin' up?You got school tomorrow.

15
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:46,244
Workin' on a high score.Did your mothergo to bed?

16
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:49,748
Yeah. Where were you?

17
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:53,001
Yeah. Compactor went downat barone sanitation.

18
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:59,007
Move over.

19
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,012
Ready?Yeah.

20
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:07,015
Go. Watch outfor the ghosts.

21
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:10,018
Whoa!

22
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:12,520
This thing ain'tsteerin' right.

23
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,522
Yeah, kickin' your butt.

24
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,525
So how things goin' with you?

25
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:22,030
How's school?

26
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:32,791
Dad, you haveto concentrate. New game.

27
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,297
Hey, no fair.It's called a handicap.

28
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:43,168
- Come on. Stop. Stop.- Kickin' your ass now.

29
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:45,804
One hand. Look at that.I can't see. Ha, ha.

30
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:53,928
Get off! Ow!Stop! Come on!

31
00:04:56,431 --> 00:05:00,935
You lose.Focus through distractions.

32
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:04,939
There's a lesson for ya.I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

33
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:10,328
Andretti, you listenin' to me?

34
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,832
Good night, dad.Good night.

35
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,452
Dr. Nathan, pleasereturn to e. R. Bay five.

36
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:21,956
Where'd you park?In the parking lot.

37
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:25,460
No one followed me.Adriana, you wouldn'tknow it if they did.

38
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,964
Oh, yeah, like tony soprano'shidin' in my backseat.You are so paranoid.

39
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:35,470
Bring the car right here.I know. He's in disguise.

40
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:40,358
That could be him. Hey, tony!Or maybe he's in the trash can.

41
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:43,361
Come out, come out,wherever you are. Ow!

42
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,864
Let go of me!

43
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:49,868
It could be anybody anytime.I don't even know ifit's tony who's after me.

44
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,871
Christopher,you gave crystal methto hisdaughter.

45
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:56,241
Which i'm not sure he knows.Look at my wrist.It's all red.

46
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,127
I'm sorry! I am sorry!

47
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:03,882
But i got dragged outto the fuckin' meadowlandsby my neck, mock execution!

48
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:06,501
What?

49
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,636
What?Nothin'.

50
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:11,639
No. What?You don't want to know,okay? Trust me.

51
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,142
No. What?

52
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,146
I heard the nurse say you madenumber two in your pants.Is that what happened?

53
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:23,151
Get the car! Please!Can we just go to brendan's,score some shit...

54
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:26,654
and find out what the fuckis goin' on, please?

55
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,776
The moon. The full moon!

56
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:34,279
Brendan, let's go.Wake up, man.

57
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,281
For the exact time.

58
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,785
The fool leaveshis door open.

59
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:42,787
I gotta pee.Go for it.

60
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,789
Yo, einstein.You should have seen meat the hospital.

61
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:49,294
It took three nursesto hold me--

62
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:52,297
you will understand and complywith the following orders.

63
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:55,550
All security personnel are to beequipped with silver bullets.

64
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,686
Those silver bullets areto be blessed by a priest,not in english, but in latin.

65
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:03,691
All passengers and personnelare to be restrictedto their cabins...

66
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,693
with the doorsbolted and locked.

67
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,196
End of orders! Sir!Yes, sir!

68
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:10,698
Take him below.Take him below.

69
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:18,072
Yeah. Yeah. Uh- huh.That's the message. Thanks.

70
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,575
Way to go, anth!

71
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,079
Here, in five, four,three, two.

72
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,583
Yo. Yo, check it.

73
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:42,480
You think this is funny?

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,483
What? What's funny?Yeah, i didn't do nothin'.

75
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,485
You beep me one more time,you're gonna be sorry.

76
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,988
We don't know whatyou're talking about.

77
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:51,990
"Your mother blows."That's a real original message.

78
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:55,860
Yeah, maybe she does,right, anth?Yeah.

79
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,863
Oh, yeah? Then why'dyou scarf up all the doughnutsshe sent us at camp?

80
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:03,251
And you used to cry on hershoulder,"i'm so homesick,mrs. Piocosta!"

81
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:06,254
Why don't you shut up?

82
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:08,506
Have another doughnut,ya fat fart knocker.

83
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:16,264
Oh, go on! Kill'im!Yeah!

84
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:18,266
Oh, yes!

85
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,768
Dick wad!Ass!

86
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:25,273
Hey! Break it up.Break it up!

87
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,276
I want a five- minutecooldown period right now.

88
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,402
See ya next week, doc.

89
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:40,905
Oh, mr. Dante,you forgot something.Oh, thank you, baby.

90
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:44,292
- Don't forget to keep flossing.- You saved my life.

91
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:47,795
All right.All right.See you next week, all right?

92
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,301
Can i help you, sir?

93
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:56,304
Sir? Sir?

94
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:20,828
Oh, my god.

95
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,333
I'm havingsecond thoughts.About?

96
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,453
This whole thing,the whole arrangement.

97
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:32,457
Security.

98
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:35,960
I come here. I tell you things.I don't know how safe it is.

99
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,463
I understandyour concerns.

100
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:42,600
But i told you what the groundrules are. As long as i don'thear anything incriminating--

101
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:46,604
you don't fuckin' get it.Just my bein' hereincriminates me.

102
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:50,608
Somebody sees me, they tellsomebody else. All of a sudden,i'm a celebrity!

103
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:54,612
I thoughtwe made some progressof your narcissism.

104
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:58,116
Who are you?

105
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:01,486
Why is that so importantfor you to know?

106
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:06,124
My mother told menever to answer a questionwith a question.

107
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:09,877
So, your motherdid teach you something.

108
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:14,132
If i asked you about your life,who you talked to,who you trust--

109
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,001
i'd have to take the fifth.

110
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:21,506
That's cute.

111
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:25,009
Oh! I--

112
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,514
i-- i'm sorry.I wasn't aware ofwhat i was...saying.

113
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:32,517
I'm...sorry.

114
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,026
Hey, what are youdoing here?

115
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:45,029
Chris sent me to pick you up.Chris? Why?Did something happen?

116
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,282
Must be my dad, right?Why else would chris send you?

117
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,785
Did brendan get my poem?

118
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,287
It's probably nothing.Another search warrant.

119
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,289
He calls them the federal bureauof annoying bullshit.

120
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,793
You told your old man,didn't you?You scared me. What happened?

121
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:03,798
This is me and adriana movin'to florida'cause some pukecouldn't keep your mouth shut.

122
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:06,684
What are you talking about?Seriously. Did brendansay anything about me?

123
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:10,054
Get us outta here!Get us out!

124
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:14,058
What did you tell your old man?About the meth? You insane?He'd have me beaten up!

125
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:16,561
Don't you get it?This is serious!

126
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,447
Let go of me!Listen--

127
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,566
stop this shit!He's worried about you.

128
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:24,819
He's been asking whereyou've been, you asshole!

129
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:28,322
I'm sorry if i hurt ya.

130
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,826
I hate my life,being a soprano.Hey.

131
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:35,329
Don't ever say you hate life.That's blasphemy.

132
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,331
Fuck you.

133
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,835
Okay, let's go. Rememberlike when you were little.

134
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,337
I'll buy you one of thosehappy meals, all right?

135
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,840
Where the fuck are you?

136
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,905
This is a new shirt.

137
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,908
Your grandmotherbought you this shirt.I find it in the trash?

138
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,911
It's a westport.It's not even cool anymore.

139
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,781
What did you just say?

140
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:12,784
I got in a fight.I hope it was worth it.

141
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:16,287
I hope you did as muchdamage to his wardrobe.Who with?

142
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:18,289
I didn't get caught.No demerits.

143
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:22,293
Anthony, who?Jeremy.

144
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:27,682
Jeremy piocosta? You spentall that time together at camp.I thought you were friends.

145
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,553
Well, if that's allthe information i'm getting,i'm calling mrs. Piocosta.

146
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,939
No, ma, wait.Ma, don't call.

147
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:37,442
I swear. You kidsare going to learnthe value of a dollar.

148
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,445
I'll wash your car.You never putany effort in.

149
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:43,448
I will. I promise.I'll do it really good.

150
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:45,450
Just don't call.I'll get the money.

151
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,953
Forty dollars, anthony.I know, i know.

152
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,963
Ma!

153
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:02,467
How ya doin'?What brings you here?

154
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,970
Remember that pastry place,ferrara's?

155
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,973
Brought yousome macaroons.

156
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:12,477
Oh, they're too sweet.

157
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:15,480
What are you talkin' about?They're your favorites.

158
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:21,986
The activities director, rosie,

159
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:26,491
says they're organizinga trip to the city.

160
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:29,494
Dinner and a show.

161
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,996
And you don't wanna go.

162
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't likethe people here.You don't know the people here.

163
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,505
And that city.Grown men soiling themselves.

164
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:43,875
- It's not like that anymore, ma.- That giuliani.

165
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,510
Maybe we should juststick to the field trip.

166
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,514
Mothers throwin' their babiesout of skyscraper windows.

167
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:52,633
You're always withthe babies out the windows.

168
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:57,138
I don't see you tryin' to mixwith the other ladies here...

169
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:01,275
or talk to the nice gentsi see walkin' around.

170
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,895
You're not makin'the most of your opportunities.What do you care?

171
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:07,398
Out of sight, out of mind.

172
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:11,402
We don't think like that,not me or carm or the kids.

173
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:14,405
I wish the lordwould take me now.

174
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:20,161
I come here to get cheered up.You think that's a mistake?

175
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,664
You bein' sarcastic?

176
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,417
You can't putall your problems on me.

177
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:29,921
This is the most expensiveretirement communityin new jersey.

178
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:33,925
If you wanted to, you could behappy here, but you're justpissing it all down the drain.

179
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:36,928
What beautiful languagefor your mother.

180
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,321
You want the macaroons?

181
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,324
I don't care.

182
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,702
Leave some outfor the lunatics.

183
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,853
Good- bye, ma.

184
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:25,610
They're sayingit might rain today.

185
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,118
Don't worry. I'll drive safe.

186
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:40,124
What the hell are you doing?

187
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:43,628
This place is an hourfrom my office.An hour?

188
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:46,130
What are you, a woman?Get a bladder transplant.My mother lives here.

189
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,633
It's not realconvenient for me.

190
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:51,135
It's not convenient?I'm sorry.

191
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:56,140
Why don't we meet by yourprecinct? The government wouldlove pictures of us together.

192
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,643
What do you got for me?

193
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:03,648
Here.

194
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:07,151
"Jennifer melfi, m. D."Yeah. Her background,daily routine.

195
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:09,654
And your personalrelationshipwith her is?

196
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,156
None of yourfuckin' business.

197
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,158
You can't blame a guyfor tryin'.

198
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:16,661
What are you,bored with your life?Oh, yeah, sure.

199
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:19,163
Bustin' whores and junkies.

200
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,284
Plus, it's a super huge thrillto pay two alimonies ona $40, 000- a- year income.

201
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:26,787
I don't want her touched.I don't want her bothered.

202
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,290
I just want to knowthe who, when, why.That's it.

203
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,293
Usual fee?

204
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:37,298
The knicks lost, lieutenant.You're down two large.

205
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:40,301
Lay off the vig.We'll see what kindof job you do.

206
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:43,304
Okay. See you in a few days.What ya got in the box?

207
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,806
Macaroons.

208
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,533
This is awful.

209
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,035
I can't deal with this.

210
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:03,791
What kind of god? Hmm?

211
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:08,162
Christopher!Where you been?

212
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,048
What happened to you?What happened to you?

213
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:13,551
Brendan's dead.What are you talkin' about?

214
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,053
The fish is in my pocket.

215
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:20,174
Brendan's brains arefloatin' in his bathtub.Message job through the eye.

216
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,310
- Mo green special.- Fuckin' uncle junior.

217
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,312
What are you talkin' about,mo green?

218
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,315
In one, mo green'seyes got too bigfor his stomach,

219
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,317
so they put a smallcaliber in his eye.

220
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,937
- Mikey palmice does their hits.- In his glasses, you mean.

221
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:34,939
Glasses, eyes.Why you quibbling with me?

222
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,942
I'm at the world trade center.

223
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,331
What are you doin'?

224
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,701
Mikey palmice is a made guy.Cocksucker didn't havethe balls to do it himself.

225
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,704
Contracted fuckin' russiansand he killed my friend.

226
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:54,842
Our response shouldsuit the message.

227
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,962
Through the mouthmeans the guy was a rat.

228
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:02,216
The eye is just howfrancis framed the shot,for the shock value.

229
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,718
Brendan didn't deserve this.Don't try to talk me out of it.

230
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,720
You can't touch mikey.

231
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,724
Your fuckin' uncle'spissin' on your head.What do you expect me to do?

232
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:15,729
I'm on it. I know wheremikey's house isover by route ten.

233
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:20,234
No. He tries to leave,you break his other neck.

234
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,251
Nurse bradley,you're wanted in e. R.

235
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:41,255
Nurse bradley,you're wanted in e. R.

236
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,151
Hey, mr. G. Q.Hey.

237
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:56,153
Got a ticket.Yeah.

238
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,772
How ya doin', mikey?How ya doin'--

239
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:06,664
son of a--look.

240
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:08,666
Your suit's wrinkled.Let me fix it.

241
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:13,287
- Ow!- What are you screaming about?Free alterations.

242
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,040
Ow! Ow!Mr. Slick.

243
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,295
This is overdue.

244
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:33,190
You hear aboutthe chinese godfather?

245
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,192
He made them an offerthey couldn't understand.

246
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:38,812
You gonna stop thisbefore it gets out of hand?

247
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:43,951
- Not even a hello?- I'm here'cause i love youand i respect you.

248
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,453
Don't pretendyou're payin' me respect.

249
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,455
A son who throws his motherin an asylum.

250
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,458
She lives likeapoverettoup there.

251
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,961
That's noneof your business.

252
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:58,966
Your friends-- they interferein my business. They expect meto turn the cheek.

253
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,218
The truck and all thatwas made good to you.

254
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:05,839
I'm sitting here like patienceon a monument, waitin' fordiscipline to be handed down.

255
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,342
Your boys were warned,and still they embarrass me.

256
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:12,346
I run my crew my way.What you did was extreme.

257
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:17,101
Now you're my judge?I answer to bigger peoplethan you, my friend.

258
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:21,605
Oh? Like jackie?Wanna take thisto his deathbed?

259
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:28,362
That nephew of yourswe gave a high colonic,uh, he earns good?

260
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,367
He's comin' up.Okay.

261
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,753
He works for me now.

262
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,255
Excuse me.

263
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,125
Maybe he gives youagitofor a change.

264
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:46,513
You got some set of balls.You know that?Absolutely not.

265
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:50,517
I show you my hand,and you slap it away.

266
00:20:54,021 --> 00:21:00,027
What's the matter with you?Why can't we talk likeadults anymore, hmm?

267
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:05,032
Out. Next time you come in,you come heavy or not at all.

268
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,537
You don't mean that.

269
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:37,731
So by the time i get to takethe sergeant exam, of course,the pay scale is frozen by law.

270
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,733
Why are we followingthese people?

271
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,736
They grabbed a meal,saw a movie, so what?

272
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,356
Lucky for youthey stopped offat that package store.

273
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:50,110
- Yeah, i got a juice.- Yeah, i can smell the potatoes.

274
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,112
Hey, listen, asshole.

275
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,616
Same make and modelleft the scene of a triplehomicide on long island.

276
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,118
Stay fuckin' current.

277
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:05,376
So you broke it off withthe poorshlubafter a week?

278
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:10,881
I know. I feel for you males.It's our goddamn faultyou don't know how to act.

279
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,884
Oh, admitting mistakes.

280
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:18,389
We tell youto be more sensitive.You join promise keepers.

281
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,892
We say get in touchwith your feelings.

282
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:26,897
You run off into the woodsin a loincloth, gunking yourselfwith bear fat, beating a drum.

283
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,400
Hey, don't ruin my evening.

284
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,902
You know what i mean.

285
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:35,406
Sure. You want someonewho's sensitive to your needs...

286
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:38,909
but still decisive enoughfor the occasional gropein the closet.

287
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:42,413
Yeah. Something like that.

288
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:46,917
Oh, shit.That's all i need.

289
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:50,304
We were going overthe speed limit?

290
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:53,307
I wasn't looking.Pull over.

291
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:18,699
License andregistration, please.

292
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:23,704
Uh, i'm sorry, officer.Did i do something wrong?

293
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:26,590
Detective.

294
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,593
You crossed a double line.Have you been drinking, sir?

295
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,712
We had wine with dinner.

296
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,348
Step out of the car, please.

297
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,850
I don't believe this.

298
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,855
Just relax, randall,and do what he says, okay?

299
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:47,361
I need you to walka straight line to me, sir.Heel to toe.

300
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:52,733
Look, uh,i applaud your vigilance,but this is totally unnecessary.

301
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,235
All right? I'm a lawyer.I know i'm under the limit.

302
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,988
Open the trunk, please.What?

303
00:23:57,988 --> 00:23:59,490
You want to searchmy golf bag?

304
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,992
Open it!I will not.

305
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:04,244
You ever hearof probable cause?

306
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:06,747
Oh, yeah, that'sa real good legalese--what?

307
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,133
Oh, you resisting arrest?

308
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,635
- Hey!-

309
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:14,138
vin, will you fuckin'cool it? Vin!

310
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:16,640
He can't do that!Get back in the car!

311
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,642
He didn't doanything wrong!Ma'am!

312
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:22,146
Back in the car. Now.

313
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:23,647
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:27,151
I perceived whati thought was a weapon.

315
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:30,654
What the hell'swrong with you, vin?

316
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:34,158
Take him. D. U. I. ,resisting arrest, assaultingan officer. Do it now.

317
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:36,660
What's he--do it!

318
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,162
Jesus.

319
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:43,667
Don't you touch me!

320
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:47,671
You got prime rib at home.Don't be goin' outfor hamburgers.

321
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:50,674
What? What are youtalking about?

322
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:55,179
Randall! Randall!I'll follow you!

323
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,183
I'm gonna call my lawyer, you!Fuck you!

324
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,302
She's seeing a randall curtin,tax lawyer.

325
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:08,308
He's lives at1242 rennsalaer road.

326
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:11,311
He's divorced.He's got two kids.

327
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:15,816
He's the country club type.Not much in the ballsdepartment, i might add.

328
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:17,568
What about her?

329
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:21,572
Her, the good doctor, she'sin her office at 8:00 a. M.She leaves at 6:00.

330
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:23,574
She orders up a tuna suband a diet coke.

331
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:28,078
She's got a three- bedroom condoin essex fells,shops at pathmark.

332
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:31,081
She's divorced.One kid, 19.

333
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:35,085
Outside of schmucko,she don't get out much,but she does see a shrink.

334
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:37,588
She what?Yeah.

335
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:41,725
She sees a shrink once a week.His name is elliot kupferburg.

336
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:44,094
Oh, fuck me.

337
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:47,598
Well, she don't fuck anyonefrom what i can tell.

338
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:50,100
Well, it's not becauseshe don't got the goods.

339
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,103
She left her blinds up.I got some of themvictoria secrettype snaps.

340
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:57,608
If you're interested.A little of this?

341
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,610
Good enough then?Yeah.

342
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,863
- You got any advil?- What am i, a fuckin'pharmacy now?

343
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:07,868
What you got on friday's game?I got three bills on rutgers.

344
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:11,872
I don't solveall your problems.

345
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:22,266
Thank you.

346
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:25,135
With a stapler? Wow.

347
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:27,638
I heard mikey had togive up that nice suit.

348
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:31,642
Yeah?He got too attached to it.

349
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:36,647
Michael palmice's beena disease since he was five.He had it comin'.

350
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,650
It don't make thingsany easier though.My uncle's a stubborn man.

351
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:42,786
Stubborn enough to go to war?

352
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,042
What kind of word is that?

353
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:54,548
There hasn't been a warsince the columbo thing.Everybody decided.

354
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:57,050
No one's goin' tothe mattresses this day and age.

355
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,554
I got a top- of- the- lineposturpedic at my house.Fuck it.

356
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:04,558
If jackie hadn'tgotten sick, none of thiswould have happened.

357
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,060
When you're right,you're right.

358
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:10,564
One of us captains gottastep up. Lack of control at thetop is fuckin' up this family.

359
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,567
- That's true.- You can say that again.

360
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:18,071
If the old man were here,instead of in that cellin springfield,

361
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:21,074
he'd say,"raymond,this is your moment."

362
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,077
Go easy withthe grease gun, okay?What?

363
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:28,582
You're the boy wonder.Both him and jackiehad you picked from day one.

364
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:31,084
You got the age.You got the seniority.

365
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:35,088
I also got an 18- year- oldwith m. S. , okay?

366
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:37,591
I told nuccii'd be doin' less, not more.

367
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,594
All due respect to yourcrippled kid, you don'twant a wire up your ass.

368
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,596
You don't want the headache.

369
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:45,599
That's why you should be boss.You're so fuckin' smart.

370
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,101
And it's"physically challenged."

371
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,604
Absolutely.

372
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,107
Why don't we run this thinglike a council?

373
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:58,612
Larry, the old guys set this upas a paramilitary organization.

374
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:04,117
We need a supreme commanderat the top, not the fuckin'dave clark five.

375
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,621
Face it. You and juniorare gonna have to duke it out.

376
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:11,625
You gotta be boss.Number one:I love the man.

377
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,129
Number two:He's got new york behind him.

378
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:20,133
Not for anything,god bless your uncle, but he'slivin' in the wrong century,

379
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,135
and new york knows it.

380
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:26,139
You want it, t?You'll get their okay.

381
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:29,643
It's the right thing.It's inevitable.

382
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:33,146
I don't want no disturbance.

383
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,163
Hey, what's up?Nothin'.

384
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:53,417
I bet you told your momwhat happened.

385
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:56,286
What are you, high?

386
00:28:56,286 --> 00:29:00,290
Well, you owe me 40 bucksfor the shirt. The collarwas totally ripped.

387
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:02,426
You still owe mefor fourth of july.

388
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:04,177
Bottle rockets?I paid for them.

389
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:08,181
Not for the m80s.Remember? The onesyou blew up the frogs with.

390
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:12,185
- Oh, yeah.That was pretty cool.- Yeah.

391
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:15,689
Listen. Just give me the money.

392
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:19,192
- That thing was so gay.I did you a favor.- You're gonna do it.

393
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,311
Make me, fatty.

394
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:24,314
- Dick wad.- Asshole.

395
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:27,818
Whoa!

396
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,821
Shithead.

397
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:33,323
Bitch-- come on.

398
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:37,077
Let's go, shithead.

399
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:40,080
- Let me go!- Why? So i cankick your ass again?

400
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:43,216
- I was kicking your ass.- Nobody won. It was a draw.

401
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:47,721
The pit tomorrow, 3:00.

402
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:51,341
You gotta help mewith these cinch bugs.They're killing my sweet corn.

403
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:54,845
Well, this blue stuff workspretty well, and it's safefor the environment.

404
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:58,348
I tried that.You got any d. D. T. Back there?

405
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:01,735
Uh, that stuff's illegal.It's been banned.

406
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:05,105
Maybe you got a surplus in theback, you could go, you look.I'll meet you back there.

407
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,858
Look, mr. Soprano,if i could dosomething, i would--

408
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:12,496
mr. Piocosta! Right?How ya doin'?

409
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:17,367
Remember our boys wentto camp aheka together?

410
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:20,003
Of course. Tony.How are ya?Good. Good.

411
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,873
Your kid still gotthat killer crossover dribble?

412
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:26,376
- Yeah, i guess so.- That's gonna get hima scholarship.

413
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:29,012
- So how's anthony?- He's moody, you know?

414
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:32,516
For a kid that age,you know?

415
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:34,634
It was nice seein' ya, tony.

416
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:38,271
Why don't we get together andcook up some dogs for the boys?

417
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:42,776
Tony, i-- i don't even knowif these guys are close anymore.

418
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:45,278
Did anthony mentionanything to you?

419
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,531
I'll have carmela call joanie.We'll get together.

420
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:50,650
- Linda.- Linda.

421
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:53,286
That's great.Tony, that's great.

422
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:56,289
I'll see you around.

423
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,325
Tony?

424
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:35,328
Yeah.Oh, my god.

425
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,330
Tony?

426
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:45,839
I thought the medicationwas supposed to helpyour panic attacks.

427
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,844
It-- it does.It's the first one in a while.

428
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:55,348
What does your therapist say?He should increase your dosage.

429
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,851
He's got more degreesthan a thermometer.

430
00:31:57,851 --> 00:32:01,354
Don't worry about it.I'll take care of it.

431
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:06,359
Does your therapistask questionsabout our marriage?

432
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,362
I know that personalfeelings are hard for youto talk about.

433
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:13,867
Talk. That'sall we do is talk.

434
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,369
Carm, i'm gonna quit.

435
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:20,874
Did you bringthis up with him?Yeah.

436
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:24,377
He knows. I guess.

437
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:30,383
Oh, shit. I forgot to takemy fuckin' prozac this mornin'.

438
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,386
It's up in the bathroom.Can you get it?

439
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:39,893
I know with jackie sickyou're undertremendous pressure.

440
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:44,397
But i feel ifthe therapy didn't hurt,it wouldn't be helping.

441
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:47,901
No, you don't understand.

442
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,905
That's why you'rein therapy. Becausei don't understand!

443
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:55,909
I'm telling you, tony,if you give up now, i'm gonnahave to reevaluate things.

444
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,411
What is that, huh?

445
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,414
I got a very sensitive job.I'm not an average joeon the block.

446
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:04,417
I gotta spell it out for you?It's our marriage, tony!

447
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,419
Therapy istoo much exposure.Fine!

448
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,923
You live withthe results then!

449
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:12,425
What's that, a threat?

450
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,295
No, tony.It's a rave review.

451
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,797
You get your ownfuckin' pills.

452
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,021
How long did the attack last?

453
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:27,023
About 30 seconds.

454
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:33,396
I was dizzy, out of breath.That's it though.I never lost consciousness.

455
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:36,900
Anything since?

456
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,905
I'm gonna writea script for xanax,just for a couple of days.

457
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:47,043
It'll get you overthis short- term stresses.

458
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:52,549
My uncle. He's got me in a boxwhere i gotta do somethingi don't wanna do.

459
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,556
And then there's my mother.

460
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:02,058
I pay four grand a monthfor this place,

461
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,063
and she acts like i'm an eskimo,pushing her out to sea.

462
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:09,816
She's testing.

463
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:13,770
Same as your uncle.

464
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:17,157
Like little kids.

465
00:34:17,273 --> 00:34:20,276
There's a good book about this.I'll give you the name.

466
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,412
No, i read, i go right out.

467
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:26,666
It'sstrategies forcoping with elder family.

468
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:30,537
Can't fuckin' spank'em though.

469
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:35,041
Would it hurt youto let your mother thinkthat she's still in charge?

470
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:38,044
You have children.You know what they're like.

471
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:43,800
You know that sometimes it'simportant to let them have theillusion of being in control.

472
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:56,946
Chris, my man!

473
00:34:57,447 --> 00:34:59,949
Surprised to see me?Heard they took youfor a little ride.

474
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:03,453
Tour of the meadowlands.Oh, yeah?

475
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:05,955
Heard you hada little b. M. Out there.

476
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:08,458
- So you got my cut?- They came and took it.

477
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:11,461
- Who?- Junior soprano's boys.

478
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:13,463
They said you was out,and it's they corner now.

479
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:17,467
- You let them do that?- I don't argue too wellsuckin' on a smith & wesson.

480
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:21,471
- You didn't beep me?- Word on the street,you out of commission.

481
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:23,973
Sorry, man. Business.

482
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:29,979
Chris, you know there'sno one i'd rather givemy ten points to than you.

483
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,234
It's all right.It's not your fault.
